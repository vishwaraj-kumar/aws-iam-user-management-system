# ðŸ“œ Custom IAM Policy: Full Access to Specific S3 Bucket

This custom IAM policy grants **full access** (`s3:*`) to a **specific S3 bucket** and all its objects.  
It is useful when you want a user or group to access only one bucket and nothing else.

---

## âœ… Use Case

> Give full access to the S3 bucket `my-bucket-name`, without giving access to any other AWS resources.
